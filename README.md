# Wheel-of-Fortune

This project involves creating a word guessing game where clients connect to a server, guess words in three different categories, and aim to win by correctly guessing one word in each category. The server, developed in Java using JavaFX and Maven, handles multiple clients concurrently on separate threads. The repository includes both the server and client programs, each with a graphical user interface designed with JavaFX. The project is intended to run on the command line using Maven commands.
